# Food Book Simulation

## Overview
**Food Book Simulation** is a C++ project that demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating a virtual recipe book. The project allows users to search, create, and print recipes of both fusion and non-fusion Indian dishes, emphasizing effective code organization and real-world application of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Key Features
- **Search Recipes:** Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine type, or dish name.
- **Create Recipes:** Users can create new recipes by providing details such as ingredients, steps, and cuisine type.
- **Print Recipes:** Users can print out recipes for easy reference.

## Types of Recipes
- **Fusion Recipes:** Creative combinations of traditional Indian dishes with elements from other world cuisines.
- **Non-Fusion Recipes:** Traditional Indian dishes that remain authentic to their origins.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation:** Recipes and their associated details (ingredients, steps, etc.) are encapsulated within classes to protect data and maintain modularity.
- **Inheritance:** Base classes are used to define common properties and behaviors, with derived classes adding specific functionalities for fusion and non-fusion recipes.
- **Polymorphism:** Demonstrated through method overriding, allowing different types of recipes to be handled uniformly while maintaining distinct behaviors.
